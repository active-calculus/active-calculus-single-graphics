# Instructions for Making Figures Work

## Prerequisites

1. Linux or macOS. This will not work on Windows because of upstream code.
1. Python **2** per [Bill Cassellman's instructions](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/piscript/install.html#prereqs). He doesn't appear to have any intention of supporting Python 3.
1. [PiScript](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/piscript/install.html) by Bill Cassellman.

## Included

1. `figures.py` comes from David Austin and is included here

## Instructions

If you get PiScript set up, then running `python 1_1_Act1.py` (or whatever the image filename is) will produce an eps file. Your first attempt will likely fail because of font-related issues. See Bill's instructions on how to fix this. On macOS, I needed to follow the instructions (with the appropriate TeXLive year) on the PiScript font help section.
